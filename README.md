# Remix Contact Tracker App Implementation

This repository showcases my personal implementation of the contact tracking app tutorial provided by Remix. The tutorial focuses on creating a basic, feature-rich contact management app without the intricacies of databases or other production-level complexities. The primary aim is to learn and apply the core concepts of Remix.

## Features of the Tutorial

1. **Emphasis on Remix**: Dive deep into Remix without the distractions of databases or other external elements.
2. **Manage Contacts**: Abilities to add, view, edit, and remove contacts.

## Prerequisites

For a thorough understanding of this implementation, prior knowledge in the following areas is beneficial:

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React basics

## About the Tutorial

The original tutorial from Remix estimates:

- **Follow Along Time**: Roughly 30 minutes.
- **Quick Read**: Designed for those skimming through the code and explanations.

## Getting Started with My Implementation

### 1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

_(Replace "your-username" and "your-repo-name" with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)_

### 2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the app:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
